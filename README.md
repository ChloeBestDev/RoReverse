# RoReverse
## About
RoReverse is a Lua script that can be executed by Wave, Solara, and other executors. It is made to aid in reverse engineering clientsided Roblox scripts.

## What Makes This Stand Out?
Compatability - RoReverse is designed to work with most executors, including ones like Solara.

Features - There is a lot of features planned to be added upon release. Some of them can be found below.

## Expected Features
RemoteSpy - Allows you to record RemoteEvent firings, helpful for making bypasses for example.

Script Environment Dumper - Basically gets stuff like constants, upvalues, etc. This may not work with some executors.

Decompiler - Uses script bytecode to generate pseudocode, similar to what the original code for that script might have been.
